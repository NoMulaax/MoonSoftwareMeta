Thank you for downloading the latest Ember update!

To support this new update, you will need to update your Supabase database. To do this, please head to:

https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/

Then paste in this Script, and press "Run":

ALTER TABLE panel_settings ADD COLUMN settings JSONB DEFAULT '{"currency_prefix": "$"}';
ALTER TABLE panel_settings ADD COLUMN psk TEXT;
ALTER TABLE panel_settings ADD COLUMN sk TEXT;
ALTER TABLE panel_invoices 
ADD COLUMN type TEXT,
ADD COLUMN commission UUID,
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_commission FOREIGN KEY (commission) REFERENCES panel_commissions (id);




After you have ran this script, you should see "Success! No rows returned.", which means the database is updated to add the new columns
